"""Scope ToolInvocation ownership and idempotency to the authenticated subject.

Revision ID: 0011_tool_invocation_ownership
Revises: 0010_relationship_ownership

Tool definitions are deployment-global control-plane records, but invocations are user-world work
bound to a Task and Project. Backfill ownership through Task -> Project, make caller idempotency
subject-local, and enforce the binding at the database boundary.
