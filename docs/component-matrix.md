# Component matrix

The component registry is intentionally broader than the currently implemented product. Presence in `config/components.yaml`, `compose.yaml` or a package manifest does **not** mean the capability is complete.

D02 (#85/#86) adds validated shared admission, bounded SQL/Web pages, recoverable memory batches
and finite transport retention. PostgreSQL and JetStream behavior and controlled child lifecycles
are covered by the exact-head CI recorded in PROJECT_STATE. This does not promote the real
Docling/Mem0/Graphiti engines or the future graphical workspaces to validated product capabilities.

## Maturity legend

- **Validated** — Nevolium integration is exercised by the current canonical CI/product path.
- **Integrated** — Nevolium code/adapters use the component, but the end-user capability or production hardening is not complete.
- **Configured** — dependency/service is wired into manifests or Compose, but no stable Nevolium product workflow is complete.
- **Scaffold** — placeholder contracts/package/application skeleton exists.
- **Declared** — architectural target only on canonical `main`.

The maturity column describes the **Nevolium integration**, not the upstream project's own maturity.

Validation is scenario-specific: controlled text fallback and memory stubs do not prove real
Docling/Mem0/Graphiti execution. D04 supplies that missing evidence. Future delivery lots are
mapped in [implementation-plan](implementation-plan.md); present progress lives in [PROJECT_STATE](../PROJECT_STATE.md).

## Important capability notes

### Gantt and Calendar

The current `packages/gantt` package contains only `ScheduledTask` / `PlanVersion` interfaces. SVAR React Gantt and Schedule-X being installed does not make Gantt/Calendar complete. G51 intentionally established canonical Task planning fields first.

### Brain / graph

The current `packages/graph` package contains only canonical graph snapshot interfaces. React Flow, React Three Fiber and react-force-graph-3d are installed but the 2D/3D mycelium Brain is not implemented on canonical `main`.

### Realtime and desktop

Hocuspocus/Yjs, Tauri and voice dependencies represent intended architecture boundaries and scaffolding. They are not yet mature end-user capabilities.

### Specialist engines

Finance, crypto, Home Assistant and OpenHands services can be present in optional profiles while still lacking stabilized Nevolium adapters, ownership rules, policy flows and UX. Optional Compose presence is not considered integration completion.

## Deliberately not foundational

- Open WebUI: useful for model/admin testing, not the Nevolium frontend foundation.
- n8n: avoided as the central automation dependency; Activepieces is the selected automation engine.
- FalkorDB: not selected due licensing concerns; Neo4j Community is the Graphiti backend.
- Kuzu: not selected because the project is archived/deprecated for this use.
- OpenClaw: the V0 proof runtime is removed from the target architecture; its durable-execution lessons are carried forward into Temporal and Nevolium policy contracts.

D03 profiles and refused prototype activations are documented in [deployment](deployment.md).
Validation of deployment controls does not promote the optional engines to real integration evidence.

## D04 branch qualification

PR #88 adds actual CPU Docling/Mem0/Graphiti execution on offline read-only assets, local model
accounting/restart and live SearXNG search; persistent OpenBao and two-host recovery are in the same
campaign. These are branch proofs pending integration, not a blanket promotion of the canonical
maturity table above. See [qualification](qualification-d04.md) and the exact-head checkpoint.
All five campaign jobs passed again on the Nevolium head `d9478de…`, including actual
object/message/secret readback on a distinct CI host. [Dated measurements and preserved evidence](archive/qualification-d04-2026-09-11.md)
and [identity-transition evidence](archive/nevolium-identity-transition-2026-09-11.md) record the
campaign chronology.
The private target, mixed load, ingress and upgrade/recovery scenario remain H5 acceptance conditions.
