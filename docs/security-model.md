# Nevolium security and authority model

Nevolium is designed to observe, reason and eventually act across sensitive personal systems. Capability therefore remains separate from authority at every layer.

## Authority levels

### A0 — Read / observe
Approved integrations may be read without per-action confirmation.

Examples: read project data, inspect system health, search public information, read market data, inspect analytics.

### A1 — Internal Nevolium write
May change Nevolium-owned reversible state.

Examples: create notes, update task status, add graph relationships, write research reports.

### A2 — Prepare an external action
May construct and validate an action but cannot cause the external side effect.

Examples: draft an email, prepare a deployment plan, build an unsigned transaction, simulate a trade.

### A3 — Narrow standing external authority
May execute only a precisely pre-authorized, reversible/low-consequence standing order with scope, destination, limits and audit.

Examples: send Nevolium notifications, perform known-safe refreshes, publish content that was separately approved and scheduled.

### A4 — Sensitive external action
Requires explicit approval at execution time unless a future dedicated policy narrows the case safely.

Examples: consequential communication, production infrastructure changes, authentication changes, public publication that was not pre-approved.

### A5 — Critical / irreversible / financial
Strong explicit confirmation is required by default.

Examples: wallet signing, live exchange trades, transfers, destructive deletion without recoverable backup, legal commitments.

Live autonomous finance remains disabled until a separate security review/ADR explicitly defines bounded standing authority.

## Effective permission

A request may use only the intersection of:

1. user's global policy;
2. actor/agent policy;
3. project/workspace policy;
4. device capability grants;
5. integration OAuth/API scope;
6. workflow/task authority ceiling;
7. environment restrictions;
8. current approval evidence.

Default is deny.

## Policy decision before execution

Every side-effecting Temporal activity must receive a Nevolium policy decision or a verifiable approval token/capability scoped to that exact activity. A NATS event, model output or tool availability is never sufficient authorization.

## Task dispatch and resource identity

The generic public `POST /v1/tasks` accepts user-owned planning Tasks and the `foundation`
execution proof. It rejects internal capabilities, unknown capabilities and `system`/`agent`
owners with 422. Specialist executions must enter through their dedicated Core APIs, which
establish ownership, policy inputs and canonical resource links. Core adapters construct ORM
Tasks directly; clients must not manufacture their internal input payloads.

Core checks those links both before starting Temporal and when a queued execution begins:
ToolInvocation and DocumentVersion must point back to the executing Task; semantic routing
must match the Command's routing Task; memory uses its deterministic generation identity,
system owner and memory Project; News and Research requesters must match the Project owner.
Unknown or invalid bindings return 409 before dispatch, including Tasks created before this
restriction. Invalid legacy queued Tasks remain blocked for operator inspection; this change
does not automatically delete or repair them.

The Worker also compares tool context with the current Task before returning a completed
result or calling the tool. A completed result remains replayable by its own Task. Terminal
tool failure propagation carries the executing `task_id`, which Core checks before any ledger
mutation. Core and Worker must be upgraded together because this internal failure request now
requires that field. Reverting the restriction would reopen the audited dispatch vulnerability.

These controls protect against public-client dispatch forgery. They do not make the shared
internal service token a per-Task credential, and must be read with the D03 production boundary below.

## Secrets

OpenBao is the source for service/integration secret material.

Rules:

- Git contains templates only;
- PostgreSQL stores opaque secret references, not secret values;
- LLM prompts receive the minimum derived information required for reasoning;
- tools that require secrets obtain them inside the execution boundary, not through the model context;
- credentials are separated by environment/integration and rotated independently;
- audit logs redact secret values.

## Crypto signing boundary

Nevolium can read portfolio data, analyze risk, prepare and simulate transactions, and request approval.

Private keys/seed phrases must never be accessible to PydanticAI, LiteLLM, Mem0, Graphiti, Langfuse, chat history or ordinary application logs.

Preferred execution flow:

```text
Agent analysis
 -> TransactionProposal
 -> deterministic validation/simulation
 -> Nevolium policy decision
 -> explicit user approval
 -> isolated signer / hardware wallet / user wallet
 -> broadcast adapter
 -> immutable audit record
```

The signer exposes a narrow signing API or user interaction, not raw key export.

## Local-device boundary

The Tauri Sidecar is a separate trust boundary. Server authorization does not automatically grant microphone, clipboard, screenshot, filesystem or shell access on a registered device.

Local capability grants are explicit, revocable and auditable.

## Browser/code execution

Untrusted or agent-generated code should run in isolated containers. Production deployment should use gVisor or an equivalent strengthened sandbox where supported.

Browser sessions use dedicated profiles/credentials and least privilege. Playwright deterministic flows are preferred over free-form AI browsing for sensitive actions.

## Identity

Keycloak provides authentication/SSO. Nevolium remains single-user initially but uses proper subject/device identities from the beginning so later multi-user/team scenarios do not require replacing the authorization model.

## Audit

Security/autonomy events record:

- actor and device;
- request/trigger;
- domain entity/workflow correlation;
- policy decision and authority level;
- tools/integrations invoked;
- model/provider/cost where relevant;
- external destination/side effect;
- approval evidence;
- idempotency key;
- result/error/retry;
- artefacts produced.

Langfuse traces AI behavior, but the Nevolium audit log remains the security source of truth.

## Backup and recovery

restic performs encrypted off-host backups of canonical databases/config/object data according to a tested restore procedure. Backups must be verified before enabling higher authority levels.

## Self-modification

Nevolium may diagnose itself and prepare code/config changes. It may not silently alter core policy, authentication, secrets, production infrastructure or deploy unreviewed code. Self-change flows require a diff, tests, backup/rollback plan and approval.


## D03 production boundary

Production enforces access-token audience/authorized party/type, denies development configuration,
separates runtime SQL DML from migrations and verifies actual Core privileges before serving.
Global memory rebuild requires an operations token absent from Workers; trusted Worker execution
still uses its shared service token plus existing task/lease/owner bindings.

Public HTML reads use a validated numeric IP for the connection, origin Host and TLS SNI, no ambient
proxy/credentials, validation of each redirect, streamed 2.5 MB limits and a 30-second deadline.
Internal networks and resource ceilings narrow exposure; they do not isolate hostile code from a
trusted Worker or replace a multi-host TLS design. Secret value validation cannot establish an
OpenBao token's real policy. See [deployment](deployment.md) and [ADR-028](decisions/ADR-028-production-boundaries-and-optional-topology.md)
for preparation, trust assumptions and D04 evidence still required.
