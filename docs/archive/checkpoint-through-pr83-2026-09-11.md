H3b2e merged as `6286819f1cf924dd1338311e8e43a1941c496dba`. `hardening/h3b2e-final-image-pins` is retired and must not be reused. Product work remains paused.

### H1 — Memory/Auth handoff

Canonical merge:

- PR #74 — `H1: fix authenticated memory projection handoff`;
- merge commit: `3fa1aa5a67628c97ee4367e9a0224cff9086fbf0`;
- validated implementation head: `cf04b45d7a10fcc07af16e8e5806f2ddd2d1249f`.

H1 moved Worker-triggered system memory Tasks from the authenticated public user endpoint to an internal-token-protected system-only handoff. Authenticated Keycloak + Core + Worker regression coverage proves projections reach `projected` while cross-user reads remain isolated.

`hardening/h1-memory-auth-handoff` is retired and must not be reused.

### H2 — Code hygiene

Canonical merge:

- PR #75 — `H2: remove dead code and add static-quality guardrails`;
- merge commit: `31e53b88135ac2db4600bb00a4112bc14d46ba5d`;
- validated implementation head: `70febab5c06840620557d0fcefd596e20e3f9758`;
- final PR head: `ca2464b70114de4d4d9ad5e91071f8f38982943f`.

H2 removed proven dead code/dependencies/settings, added LF normalization and focused Ruff/Bash static-quality checks, and remained intentionally narrow. Final PR checks were green.

`hardening/h2-code-hygiene` is retired and must not be reused.

### H3a — Dependency locks and frozen direct CI

Canonical merge:

- PR #76 — `H3a: lock dependency graphs and freeze direct CI installs`;
- merge commit: `ecc3394a648070b16ab4505e07706006999ab945`;
- validated implementation head: `6a62b7ac8411543ddd6c4253675f00bae5538b62`;
- final PR head: `215927227baaf051865d9a5b59c65cf2c0f934d0`.

H3a added canonical `pnpm-lock.yaml`, root UV workspace `uv.lock`, `uv.toml` requiring `uv==0.12.13`, frozen/locked direct CI installs and a fail-closed reproducibility contract. Final PR head passed 9/9 workflows, including Foundation and the real Worker SIGKILL Research replay.

`hardening/h3a-dependency-locks` is retired and must not be reused.

### H3b1 — Locked Nevolium container builds

Canonical merge:

- PR #77 — `H3b1: build Nevolium containers from canonical locked graphs`;
- merge commit: `e43e192938ce412f534eb68e989e7408289be3be`;
- final validated PR head: `ac5835f0071412236dc6797c0c7911fbcf317164`.

H3b1 solves **Nevolium-owned container dependency/build reproducibility only**. Core, Worker, Realtime and Web consume canonical locked dependency graphs; Reproducibility CI builds all four images; the Research crash overlay follows the same Worker build contract. Final PR-head validation passed 8/8 workflows, including Foundation and the real Worker SIGKILL Research replay.

`hardening/h3b1-container-locks` is retired after merge and must not be reused. The connector does not expose branch-ref deletion, so the inert remote ref may remain.

### H3b2a — Nevolium Node build-base digest pins

Canonical merge:

- PR #78 — `H3b2a: pin Nevolium Node build images by digest`;
- merge commit: `f51ac9c0b00c46b046bb24b751540d204763bcbc`;
- validated technical head: `538af6072bee2239187339a0bf66bda8c29fa916`;
- final validated PR head: `93ad537c29d2862d210f977ab8344ef9b0c6fcd7`.

H3b2a is deliberately limited to the two Nevolium-owned Node build-base references. No Compose service image changed in this sub-gate.

Canonical H3b2a changes:

1. `apps/web/Dockerfile` pins `node:22-alpine` to `sha256:c610fcdfb1d5b4740dd70c284ed3cb16bb857e0f7166196e36a5501df7a3aa32`.
2. `services/realtime/Dockerfile` pins the same `node:22-alpine` image to the same digest.
3. The digest was already observed and successfully used by the final H3b1 Reproducibility build, so the intended Node tag/version line did not change.
4. `config/reproducibility-baseline.json` advances to version 4, records both Node Dockerfiles as validated digest pins, and reduces known unpinned-image debt from **31 to 29** references.
5. `scripts/smoke/reproducibility_contract.py` keeps the same fail-closed behavior; only its success message is generalized beyond H3b1.

Final PR diff contained exactly four H3b2a technical files plus this checkpoint file:

- `apps/web/Dockerfile`;
- `services/realtime/Dockerfile`;
- `config/reproducibility-baseline.json`;
- `scripts/smoke/reproducibility_contract.py`;
- `PROJECT_STATE.md` — checkpoint evidence only.

Technical-head validation on `538af607...`: **8/8 push workflows success**.

Final PR-head validation on exact head `93ad537c...`: **8/8 workflows success**:

- Baseline reproducibility validation — run `34587827514` — success, including real Nevolium container builds using the digest-pinned Node base;
- Foundation validation — run `34587827426` — success;
- Autonomous Research validation — run `34587827470` — success, including the real Worker SIGKILL replay proof;
- MCP tool registry validation — run `34587827453` — success;

### H3b2b — Core Compose service digest pins

Canonical merge:

- PR #79 — `H3b2b: pin core service images by digest`;
- merge commit: `f510043eb69b63919c6d012208f9b64b2bb63749`;
- validated technical head: `b3d6fe1a54907699f5f15aa8243620d3cc112e7a`;
- final validated PR head: `e6170558584cf231de228ff0f11b591dfe86b509`.

H3b2b is deliberately limited to three heavily shared core Compose services. No service tag/version changed.

Canonical H3b2b changes:

1. `postgres` keeps `pgvector/pgvector:0.8.6-pg17` and pins it to `sha256:cf134a767f474095eeba57e0117be8e568e011a63f33fbf252f14c9b760f8e6f`.
2. `valkey` keeps `valkey/valkey:8.1.10-alpine` and pins it to `sha256:d2e18f3410b6f616de1417f570fa55261af2898b9c5b2cfb6781ce2373ea43d1`.
3. `nats` keeps `nats:2.14.5-alpine` and pins it to `sha256:d4ac35882ac65aff236cd65b9d3fa4d24332c681e1a85f94eedccd3cdd65b1da`.
4. `config/reproducibility-baseline.json` advances to version 5, records these exact Compose digest pins, and reduces known unpinned-image debt from **29 to 26** references.
5. `scripts/smoke/reproducibility_contract.py` now fail-closes on drift of the validated Compose digest set, including replacement of one immutable digest by another without an explicit baseline update.

Final PR diff contained exactly three H3b2b technical files plus this checkpoint file:

- `compose.yaml`;
- `config/reproducibility-baseline.json`;
- `scripts/smoke/reproducibility_contract.py`;
- `PROJECT_STATE.md` — checkpoint evidence only.

Technical-head validation on exact head `b3d6fe1a54907699f5f15aa8243620d3cc112e7a`: **8/8 push workflows success**.

Final PR-head validation on exact head `e6170558584cf231de228ff0f11b591dfe86b509`: **8/8 pull-request workflows success**:

- Baseline reproducibility validation — run `34589403058` — success, including baseline-drift proof and locked Nevolium container builds;
- Foundation validation — run `34589403074` — success, including Compose topology and integration checks;
- Autonomous Research validation — run `34589403065` — success, including the real Worker SIGKILL replay proof;

- Code quality validation — run `34589403070` — success.

The same exact final head also triggered the eight push-event mirrors; all **16/16** workflow executions completed successfully with no failure, cancellation or timeout.

### H3b2c — Temporal Compose digest pins

Canonical merge:

- PR #80 — `H3b2c: pin Temporal images by digest`;
- merge commit: `082a296650d77ebbe247bb3d5360b15e621c2596`;
- base `main` at branch creation: `8a85918ab8fed681093a32ba1b2e1d4242050433`;
- validated technical head: `d5514db9fa4baf4e22a0f5f594843d5df956ce5e`;
- final validated PR head: `f0edad27bf7a2ebbc7f905bec8c1cdf52943f33e`.

H3b2c is deliberately limited to the Temporal Compose image family already configured by `.env.example`. No Temporal tag/version changed.

Canonical H3b2c changes:

1. `temporalio/server:${TEMPORAL_VERSION}` keeps `TEMPORAL_VERSION=1.31.2` and is pinned to `sha256:b5ecdb8282bededae2a10c36e8d862e27d0bc2d247fc73c5416025997ab4a1da`.
2. `temporalio/admin-tools:${TEMPORAL_ADMINTOOLS_VERSION}` keeps `TEMPORAL_ADMINTOOLS_VERSION=1.31.2` and both Compose uses are pinned to `sha256:dbc5fcd6ee8f0f4d808bf765af9a87dea9d8a283abfdcfbd2fc148496ba66107`.
3. `temporalio/ui:${TEMPORAL_UI_VERSION}` keeps `TEMPORAL_UI_VERSION=2.53.0` and is pinned to `sha256:810eba47f77a89b0e64e2e751478ca585d037bbd90c0951a2974a92a6c5adeb9`.
4. `config/reproducibility-baseline.json` advances to version 6, records the three exact Temporal Compose digest tuples, and reduces known unpinned-image debt from **26 to 23** references.
5. No reproducibility-contract code change was needed: H3b2b already made validated Compose digest pins fail closed on removal or immutable-digest substitution without an explicit baseline update.

Final PR diff contained exactly two H3b2c technical files plus this checkpoint file:

- `compose.yaml`;
- `config/reproducibility-baseline.json`;
- `PROJECT_STATE.md` — checkpoint evidence only.

Technical-head validation on exact head `d5514db9fa4baf4e22a0f5f594843d5df956ce5e`: **8/8 push workflows success**:

- UI workspace validation — run `34591125050` — success;
- Code quality validation — run `34591125013` — success.

The same exact final head also triggered eight push-event mirrors. The final check found exactly eight push runs, all completed, with no failure, cancellation, timeout, action-required, startup-failure, neutral, skipped, stale or pending conclusion; therefore all **16/16** final-head workflow executions were successful.

### H3b2d — Backup/restore operations digest pins

Canonical merge:

- PR #81 — `H3b2d: pin backup restore images by digest`;
- merge commit: `2e6fffffb09d8cc0fd191b79773d50b5daa8381b`;

- final validated PR head: `be7af95df15ba72c0a5fd6fcdd497d95f710b610`.

H3b2d is deliberately limited to the backup/restore operations image family in `compose.ops.yaml`. No configured image tag/version changed.

Canonical H3b2d changes:

1. `restic/restic:0.19.1` is pinned to `sha256:136600b6ff6843d61d355f7f71f460a166429f35de6fd11b568fece3c9a4d510`.
2. Both operations services using `alpine:3.22` (`volume-restore` and `ops-cleanup`) are pinned to `sha256:14358309a308569c32bdc37e2e0e9694be33a9d99e68afb0f5ff33cc1f695dce`.
3. `config/reproducibility-baseline.json` advances to version 7, records both exact operations Compose digest tuples, and reduces known unpinned-image debt from **23 to 21** unique `(path,image)` references.
4. No reproducibility-contract code change was needed: the existing validated Compose digest contract already fail-closes on removal or immutable-digest substitution without an explicit baseline update.

Final PR diff contained exactly two H3b2d technical files plus this checkpoint file:

### H3b2e — Final external image digest pins

Canonical merge checkpoint:

- PR #82 — `H3b2e: complete external image digest pinning`;
- base `main` at branch creation: `0a03a7457df38debd28ccd7c73a634b03c393ca9`;
- validated technical head: `f0b19cfaaffd5a6563a229af2858cb02579a30cd`;
- final validated PR head: `566d561303fe8367fd5edd7c4da951813e86be0b`;
- merge commit: `6286819f1cf924dd1338311e8e43a1941c496dba`.

H3b2e is the **final H3b2 implementation gate**. It consumes the complete remaining baseline debt set in one bounded final batch. No H3b2f is planned unless final validation exposes a genuine blocking defect.

H3b2e technical changes:

1. All 21 remaining `compose.yaml` external image references keep their configured tag/version strings and add the live registry digest resolved before application:

2. The complete 21-image set was resolved live with `crane digest`; resolver run `34593893012` completed successfully before the pins were applied.
3. `config/reproducibility-baseline.json` advances to version 8, records every exact Compose digest tuple, and reduces `known_unpinned_images` from **21 to 0**.
4. The existing H3b2b fail-closed Compose digest contract remains unchanged and protects all validated digest tuples against silent removal or digest substitution.
5. Temporary resolver/applicator/CI-trigger files were branch-only execution aids and are absent from the final tree. The net technical diff from the live branch base contains exactly two files:
   - `compose.yaml`;
   - `config/reproducibility-baseline.json`.

The tested PR merge ref `615055a7414bfa71d505c9bece9c6742d7af9f6f` and head shared tree `e756c733504906ba80abbd134c22ea5c2ef33226`. Expected-head merge and live-main verification succeeded.
Baseline v8 records **0** remaining unpinned references; this does not cover runtime-downloaded models or dynamically created containers.

## Independent audit and Foundation repair — 2026-09-11

- Live base checked: `0a03a7457df38debd28ccd7c73a634b03c393ca9`; PR #82 inspected at `997780e819f137dbd875b60ce0fa4f862a357ff1`.
- See [independent audit](../audit-2026-09-11.md) for evidence, service inventory and priorities. This checkpoint supersedes claims that no work branch is active.
- Original final-head CI: 14/16 runs successful. Foundation PR run `34594823443` failed on the memory smoke's premature Task-completion assertion. Foundation push run `34594817407` failed earlier on a Docker Hub connection reset, not on that assertion.
- The PR technical tree and previously green `f0b19cf…` differ only by checkpoint documentation. All 21 registry digests match Compose and baseline v8; configured tags are unchanged.
- Repair integrated through #82: seed a canonical ORM message/outbox event without dispatching News, wait for each memory Task's actual completion with a monotonic deadline, reject failed Tasks immediately, and verify no unrelated Tasks were created.
- Four synchronization regression cases pass locally; source compilation and the existing reproducibility contract pass. The real Docker memory integration and all final-head CI subsequently passed, as recorded above.
- **P0 discovered and corrected in #83:** the audited base allowed generic public Task inputs to choose internal capabilities, and the completed MCP-result path did not bind the context to the executing Task. The exact Worker function reproduced a foreign-result return using synthetic data. The canonical fix and its authenticated cross-owner/replay evidence are recorded below. This is a specific boundary repair, not blanket multi-user security certification.
- Other audited concerns: blocking Docling call in the async Worker; admission/resource/budget limits; shared deployment credentials/network; unbounded SQL/result materialization; retry/retention; unused components and incomplete real-engine proof.
- No H4/H5 completion and no product feature work are claimed. Per the current user mandate, continue from #82 into the explicit P0 security gate once #82 is validated and canonicalized; do not silently resume feature development.

## Canonical branch policy

Canonical truth is `main`. Two non-canonical salvage reservoirs remain intentionally available:

1. Legacy interface prototype at `ed12d503…` — broad salvage reservoir; never merge wholesale.
2. `consolidate/g49-research-durable-stages` — focused Research design reservoir; never resume as active development.

Retired hardening branches may remain as inert refs when the connector cannot delete refs. They are not development branches and must never be resumed.

For every gate: branch fresh from live `main`, keep scope small, validate, merge, retire, update this file, then stop.

## R6/R7 baseline summary

R6 classified the repository into active canonical files, intentional scaffolds and historical evidence; no product rewrite was justified. Intentional scaffolds include Desktop, Realtime, Gantt, Graph, Protocol and shared UI.

The exact R7 baseline `6cf3647a...` passed the canonical workflow suite, including ownership boundaries, Temporal crash/replay behavior, real Worker SIGKILL Research replay, command/model accounting, memory projections, MCP, Documents, backup/restore, Today/G51 planning and reproducibility-debt drift protection.

## Next action

Open the next bounded **H4 execution/resource safety gate** from live `main`, after reading the independent audit and verifying live refs. The current session closed #82 and the demonstrated dispatch P0; no new gate is already active.

- Move blocking Docling conversion off the Worker's async event loop using an existing execution primitive; inspect timeout, cancellation and converter lifetime together.
- Define bounded Worker admission/concurrency and resource budgets from the current topology, preserving Temporal durability. Avoid a new queue, cache or service.
- Then address production secrets/internal access/egress, SQL materialization and retention, and remove only proven unused runtime components/dependencies.
- Keep H4 overall and H5 real-engine/load validation open. Product feature work remains paused.
- Do not reuse either retired branch from this session.

### H4 Task dispatch isolation — complete and canonical

- PR #83, merge `b4f7b8e49f0afbe74643f78f12523bf69b4871d1`; validated final head `41a31005885884382674f11913d7b213a7fe7937`.
- Fresh base was live `main` `faa199a66c8b40230c6c52cf2df5fce6bf2ad92f`. `hardening/h4-task-dispatch-isolation` is retired and must not be reused.
- Public Task creation accepts only user ownership and default/`foundation` dispatch. Internal/unknown capabilities must use dedicated Core adapters.
- Core validates Task/resource bindings before Temporal dispatch and again at internal execution start, including legacy queued Tasks. The Worker checks tool Task identity before the completed-result fast path; terminal failure requests carry and validate the current Task ID before touching the invocation ledger.
- Seven Core and four Worker behavioral contract tests passed. The authenticated two-user integration passed public forgery rejection, real legacy queued Task rejection, pending/completed foreign invocation protection, no leaked Artifact and real Worker replay for the rightful owner.
- The Research boundary fixture uses the dedicated Research API; tool failure fixtures include the newly required Task ID. Core and Worker must be upgraded together. Invalid legacy queued Tasks remain blocked for inspection; no automatic cleanup/migration is included.
- Local source compilation, four memory wait regressions and reproducibility contract passed. Full GitHub validation passed **18/18 workflows** (9 push + 9 pull_request) on that final head, including Foundation, authenticated isolation and real Worker SIGKILL Research replay.
- The tested PR merge ref `74fdb3325c1c0d95d494ece4d66966afdfbdc2a8` and head share tree `31c3f8e34ccc8ddcf52908ea65139f18bdee4067`. Expected-head merge and live-main/tree verification succeeded.

Final PR run evidence:

- Autonomous research validation — `34599264240` — success;
- Baseline reproducibility validation — `34599264326` — success;
- Code quality validation — `34599264277` — success;
- Document ingestion validation — `34599264179` — success;
- Foundation validation — `34599264280` — success;
- MCP tool registry validation — `34599264212` — success;
- Multi-user isolation validation — `34599264318` — success;
- News ownership validation — `34599264259` — success;
- UI workspace validation — `34599264294` — success;

This checkpoint is a documentation-only follow-up to the validated merged tree. Remaining production/resource/security findings and H5 stay open; no blanket production-readiness or load-capacity claim is made.
